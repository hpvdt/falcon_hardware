## Introduction
Created for the Falcon Aircraft, the Falcon Aircraft Flight Stick (FAFS) is the first flight stick to implement **three** axes of motion detection, remain rigid, and feature up to 25 programmable buttons. This was done to accommodate the unique nature of the Human-powered falcon aircraft, where the user could control the entire aircraft with one hand, keeping the other free, while maintaining a durable and versatile design. 

The design features:
- An STM32 Microcontroller programmed with custom firmware and libraries
- An ADS131 amplifier and ADC paired with linear and torque strain gauges
- A 5x5 transistor array to feature up to 25 buttons
- Power indicators and Multi-colour LEDs to indicate device function
- USB-C connectivity to plug into a computer to use as a joystick
- STLinkV3 programmability with SWD and UART
